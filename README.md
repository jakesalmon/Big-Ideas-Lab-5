## The Name Repeater
### Carmen Campagna and Jacob Salmon

Our  program is a very simple one! The goal of the Name Repeater is to prompt the user for their name, and subsequently ask them how many times they would like the program to print their name into the console. This is a feature that is extremely useful if you want to see your name printed x number of times into a console. I have this desire on a daily basis so I created a machine to fulfill my needs.

#### Code Segment 1
```
name = input("What is your name?")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```
This portion of the code asks the user for their name, and then says hello to them! Very cool and smart.

#### Code Segment 3
```
if (int(iteration) < 0 ):
    print("Stop being smart with me. Try again.")
```
This portion of the code catches the user if they are trying to sabotage my grade by finding an error.

#### Code Segment 2
```
iteration = input("How many times do you want me to repeat your name?")
for x in range(int(iteration)):
    print(name)
```
This portion of the code asks the user how many times the program should repeat their name, and even goes on to repeat their name that number of times. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!

#### Here is an example of how to use our very complicated program
1. Once you run the program, the computer will ask you for your name. Enter your name, and then click the return/enter key. Let's say I put my name in as "Dukerson".
2. After pressing enter and telling the computer your name, it will say hello to you. Do not be frightened.
3. It will then ask you how many times you'd like the program to print your name out in the console. You can choose any number you please! If I put in the number '3' here, our final output would be as follows:
Jake
Jake
Jake
Jake
